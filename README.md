Research project on Enhancing Large-scale classification using Artificial Neural Networks

My research is based on this paper: X. Wu, Y. Zhang, and W. Fan, "Linear Regression based Efficient SVM Learning for Large-Scale Classification," IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and 
Data Engineering, vol. 26, no. 12, pp. 3025-3038, Dec. 2014. DOI: 10.1109/TKDE.2014.2308558.

The authors in the paper talk about how Linear regression-svm algorithm can be effectively used for large-scale classification and they also claim this algorithm performs better than traditional SVM algorithms. I wanted to see how true their claim is and also, I wanted to see whether neural networks could be effectively used for large scale classification. The algorithms I used for my research are: RBF kernel SVM, Linear kernel SVM, Linear Regression-SVM, Feedforward Neural networks, MLPRegressor. I compared these algorithms on three parameters - accuracy, f1 score and training time. 

The datasets I worked on are MNIST dataset and USPS dataset.
